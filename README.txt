What do I need to make this work?

This is the complete iOS code for Book Scan for Craigslist. The only thing missing is two server side APIs. The first one simply gets the book info based on the 13 digit ISBN (also known as the EAN). The second is an API which posts to craigslist using the email address and city selected by the user. I decided not to include this code because it would be too useful to spammers and I don't want to ruin Craigslist. 

How to implement the APIs

The chegg API requires you to sign up with them and get an API key. The craigslist API needs to be created from scratch. You can do this yourself or if you have a legitimate use for it I can share it with you.

That's it. The next feature I am working on uses online data to calculate a FairPrice. To get a preview of that feature visit my website http://fairbookprice.com.
